## Business Problem:

The retailer aims to improve sales performance and revenue by accurately predicting food item sales across various stores. By understanding the key factors influencing sales and optimizing strategies accordingly, the retailer aims to maximize profitability.

## Data:

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Analytics Vidhya. It contains historical sales data for various products sold at Big Mart outlets. The dataset includes attributes such as product weight, visibility, store location, and other relevant features.

## Methods:
### Data Preparation: 

Preprocessing steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Justification: These steps are necessary to ensure compatibility with machine learning algorithms and to avoid bias in model training.

## Results:
### Visual 1: Correlation Heatmap of Numerical Features

This visualization provides insights into the distribution of the "Item_Weight" feature in the Big Mart Sales dataset. The histogram illustrates the frequency distribution of item weights, while the boxplot displays summary statistics such as median, quartiles, and outliers.

# Model:

## Description:

The final model employs a regression-based approach to predict sales volume based on various product attributes, store characteristics, and other relevant features.

## Reported Metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): X
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Y
R-squared: Z

# Recommendations:

Based on the insights gained from the analysis and model predictions, Big Mart should consider implementing targeted marketing campaigns, optimizing inventory management strategies, and adjusting pricing strategies to capitalize on product attributes and store characteristics that drive sales.

# Limitations & Next Steps:

## Limitations:

Limited historical data: The availability of historical data may limit the model's ability to capture long-term trends accurately.

## Next Steps:

Further research could focus on integrating additional external factors such as economic indicators, customer demographics, and competitor analysis to enhance the predictive capabilities of the model.
