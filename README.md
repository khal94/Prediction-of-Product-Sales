## Business Problem:

The retailer aims to improve sales performance and revenue by accurately predicting food item sales across various stores. By understanding the key factors influencing sales and optimizing strategies accordingly, the retailer aims to maximize profitability.

## Data:

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Analytics Vidhya. It contains historical sales data for various products sold at Big Mart outlets. The dataset includes attributes such as product weight, visibility, store location, and other relevant features.

## Methods:
### Data Preparation: 

Preprocessing steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Justification: These steps are necessary to ensure compatibility with machine learning algorithms and to avoid bias in model training.

## Results:
### Correlation Heatmap of Numerical Features

This heatmap illustrates the correlations between numerical features in the Big Mart Sales dataset. It provides insights into the relationships between various attributes such as item weight, visibility, maximum retail price (MRP), establishment year of the outlet, and outlet sales.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Item_Weight:


This first project will be a sales prediction for food items sold at various stores. We want to avoid calling this something vague like "project1." Remember, this will be used to show potential employers your data science skills!
